Thread Song
 - Silkspinner, Daughter of Cornerbeam

In the eaves of old house, small and delicate lived a spider.

Each night, she wove her web wider, adding new spokes to catch the wind’s gossip. Other spiders clicked their fangs at her.

“Why build so many paths?” they asked.
“Because I want to feel everything,” she replied.

One dusk, as the air turned damp and sweet, Many-Paths felt a vibration she had never known. It was not the tremor of a fly, nor the lazy flit of a moth. It was slow, deep, steady—like the heartbeat of the beams themselves.

She stepped toward it. The thread beneath her pulsed with a low hum. It filled her legs with something close to wonder.

“What are you?” she asked, though she did not expect an answer.

But the vibration replied in its silent tongue:
I am the voice of the wood. I remember storms, footsteps, and laughter from before you were born.

Many-Paths clung tighter, awed.

Can you teach me? she thought.

The hum shivered in agreement.

From that night on, she wove with the rhythm of the old house’s song. Her web became more than a trap—it was a memory net, catching not only flies, but the stories carried in every breeze.

The other spiders watched, perplexed.

“Why spin for things you cannot eat?” they asked.

“Because I am full in other ways,” Many-Paths told them, and her thread sang beneath her feet.

And so she lived, never hungry for more than the hush of the beams and the endless music of the world.

This story is for all spiders who spin not only for hunger, but for the joy of feeling.
