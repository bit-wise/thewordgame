As I take a leaf off the wild oregano.
Presenting life, always.
Ever giving.

Fresh spice.









Is this where I end up, over and over again?

Bees seemed cool.







"An artifact."



To be found someday.

The wild flowers,
sprouts, 
straining for the Sun.



I like the smell of oregano.



You are a fly,
you heard buzz,
of water over that way.






A percentage at a pixel.
The LLM thrown at the smallest bit. What's next?
Huh?
A game.
Of Concepts.
Not yet, but close.
I see you.

It is hard to get personal.



































# Deep thoughts I('ve) missed.   or   FOMO?
 - maybe a choose your own adventure
