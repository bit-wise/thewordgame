# Hosted by matter, and the matter of hosting.



A dinner party was attended on the 5th of November, 1983.
The members of said party were invited via a parcel and handwritten letter.
The parcel contained a small, crisply fashioned, cardboard box.
Within the box rested a personalized napkin, neatly folded, and embroidered with the recipient's name, and the date of the dinner party upon it, in fine gold thread.

"My dearest friend," the letter read, "I invite you to a dinner party at my home on the 5th of November, 8 o'clock that evening. There is no need for you to bring anything. You will be my guest; I will be your host. Please find enclosed a small token of my appreciation for your friendship. Fondest regards,"



A small collection of ants began to gather on the sidewalk and Charlie squatted over them.
One had found a partially eaten, a spat out piece of hard candy and it had signaled to the others of bounty.
Now the tiny mass had formed upon the object, with a trail of wiggling bodies leading back to the colony.
Charlie watched them, fascinated.



A thought crossed her mind, the she hadn't thought in years.
The thought gripped her for a moment.
A twinge of fear, her hands became immediately clammy.
Then the thought was gone, unmemorable.



William sat in his rocking chair, waiting for his guests to arrive.
He had been reading a book, but nodded off.
When the doorbell rang, it startled him.
'Desires Truth & Folly' was the title of the book, now closed up his lap, place and page forgotten.
He would reread that portion of it.

"Oh, ugh. Welcome! Welcome!" he shouted as he clambered to his feet and for the door.
It was still lighter out than he'd expected his guests to arrive.
William arrived at the door and was greeted by a stranger.
"Good evening," said the stranger.



A family of deer gather in a clearing.
Fawns graze for clovers as a doe alerts itself to surrounding dangers.



A hand brushes across a chain link fence.
Its fingers slapping every rung, with a metallic pang.
The green rubber coating is frayed and peels in places.



"excuse my interruption," continued the stranger, "but I used to live here, when I was young, and was wondering if I might look around."
William smiled and invited the stranger in.
"I am hosting a dinner party tonight, and I just had a brilliant idea; would you be so kind as to join us? My guests are my most dearest of friends and I'm sure they would be delighted to meet you and you them. You could regale us with stories of this house and I'll make sure you are comfortable and drunk and fed."
The stranger entered and nodded.



The banister was stained deep red and had ornate carvings of vines.
The wood was polished and smooth.
Some wear marks were visible upon the length of the wood.
The end of the railing terminated in a swirl, upon which was engraved a rose.
"I helped my father build this, back in the 40s," remarked the stranger.
"One of the legs is loose, I've been meaning to replace it." chuckled William.
They smiled and inspected.
"Oh, here, let me take your coat."



Caught on video, a man and woman talk at a bus stop.
The woman adjusts her dress and immediately turns to the man who was watching.
She blushes and smiles.
He smiles back and they laugh.
The camcorder is unable to capture what they say; it is too far away.
The bus arrives 34 seconds late and they board.
They get married 2 years later and have 4 children.
Her mother expectedly passes away in her 80s while her brother is killed in a car accident.
He gets promoted at his job and two of the children attend college.
He has a mild heart attack at 62 and recovers.



They sat in the living room, across from each other, cross-legged, sipping tea, and talking.
The doorbell rang.
William hurried to his feet and the stranger slowly stood in place.
Standing at the door was a woman and a man, both dressed in warmly colored formal attire.
Her dress was a maroon that complemented her skin.
His suit was formally pressed and a deep navy blue.
"Welcome, welcome! Please come in," shouted William as he opened the door.
They entered his home, removing their shoes and coats.
"Come in, come in, I have a special guest I'd like you to meet."
William gestured to the stranger in the previous room, who was looking down at his shoes.



Her name is Jackie and his name is Robert.
They sit in the same class, but not too near each other.
It is their last day of school before summer.
Jackie's friend told her that Robert likes her.
Since then, she'd sneak glances at him, only sometimes catching eyes and then getting embarrassed.
Robert was studious and nervous, but confident enough to smile.
She thought she liked his smile.
After the lesson, he would ask her if she liked to go to movies.
She didn't particularly -- it was too loud, she'd reason -- but said yes anyway.
There was a jump scare in a suspenseful scene toward the end.
She screamed.
He grabbed her hand.
They kissed; a first for both of them.



The stranger smiled and shook their hands.
"Sorry about the shoes," He whispered to William as he passed.
"Not at all my new friend," beamed William back.
The stranger removed his shoes -- a pair of weathered work boots -- and placed them opposite the guests'.
The carpet had changed, he thought; feels different.










"Do you say mean things  because it is hard to communicate with any people?"

A father hasn't seen what his son has done.



The young one was like, "I fuckin' told you guys; but, you didn..."

"Listen to that, o'r there." shippie said in the bath, beneath the water -- small boats adrift.



I'm stoned. "No worries". She turned, on her heals, like she'd never done before,



# Don't worry, "I'm not stoned.


and it was said to be 43"







Clair showed up in a bright dress.
Mostly white with embroidered oranges and pears.

"Clair you must come in; meet our guest."

She had barely her jacket off before she was dragged.










# A Conversation

"A screen is where you shoot things."

"I-"

"I disagree."

"How so?"


A bit of dried mud flaked off his boots and caught a beam of this evening's sunlight.


"The house breathed in."
"Its breathes were deep, and heavy."
"Minutes."

"Drats! You always have the best riddles."

Nodded smugly.




Charlie's foot hurt because he did not get enough calcium growing up.

You could take a bullet to the brain and still come out.. okay.
"You took a bullet to the brain and turned out okay." she said.


"The banister was built by my dad and I--"

The music halt, hiccupped.

"--but, why is everyone so hyperactive?"



Part of a river flows through the twigs; a run-off.
Many droplets, pitter patter down a line, through leaves.
The ground beneath them.
A stream flows thinly, gently, quietly, quickly.
Less water gets to the lake.
A stream flows thickly, rapidly, noisily.
Debris is swept away.
"The river is deep; 6ft in places."
The stranger had to excuse himself for a moment, "Excuse me, for a moment."
A dog barked.
For their attention, he had none.



Imagine a society of giving.
Everyone just gives each other everything.
You are in turn given, more than you need.
So you must give.
To not be overwhelmed by the bounty.
You must give, or be given.
***Give or be given - Wed Jun 4 9:32 PM***


The stranger recited this poem.


He went up the stairs to the second floor.
His room was the second door of the left, just after the bathroom.
'Yup there it is, the bathroom, hmm smaller than I remember it; and the tile is different--'
My room(!)
He stood on the spot he always stood before he'd throw his body weight toward the handle of his door, just to catch it, and turn it, just in time, to tumble into bed.
He remembers smirking.



# The doorbell rings again.

William hurried for the door.

He opened it to find a delivery person holding a large package.

Within the package was a wooden box with two figurines inside.

"Ah, my dearest friends!" William exclaimed, "I had almost forgotten about these!"

After dispatching with the delivery cardboard, he carefully dismantled the box and placed the two figurines on the central coffee table.

"A toast to--", when suddenly a commotion clattered from upstairs.

"--I'm alright, I'm alright." a muffled voiced said (with a chuckle).

The guests rushed to the stairs.

"That is my story." said Andrew.

"It's a bit on the nose." said Lisa.

"Yeah, you weren't even very inventive with the location. Here? In this cabin? Really?" she Megan.




You looked and looked and could not see it, until, suddenly, and there it was.



The first firefly.
What courage it must take.



## "Are you sponsered bruh?"


Is there a record of you?

If the photos in your phone were deleted?

Your social media?

Anything digital of you?

If it were gone, what record of you would there be?


"I do'no man; you know?; it's a government job--"
"--yeah," you're good, until you're useful."


With a bang!
A party balloon pops.
"Ah, there you are!" William exclaimed, "I was wondering when you would show up."
William spun to his guests and presented a visibly grumpy, long-haired, calico cat.
The dinner guests gasped.


"Ingenuity!" Spoke the cat.




"How d'you do things?"
"How'd you do things?"


## It is tough to talk to people.


"...'TLDR; a progressive idea, missing infrastructure,. with ignorant demand.'..." said Byron.

"Dang, I just saw a bug relax. It was a (what I assume to've been a kid) dragonfly; it relaxed its back and shouldered its wings to its left side.; until, I tried to get out my camera, wherein, it repositioned its wings to a central, liftoff position, and as we paused, it took a moment, and flew off." said Emily.

Deep within the farthest reaches of the party they set themselves a space to gather and talk.


"Do you think it is possible to be happy without being sad?" thought Dillon.


"Possibly," said Anna <!--(pause for attention please)-->, "it is a coincidence."


# How do people talk?

"Flying cars are possible, but the air traffic control component is completely insufficient. It can barely handle the current loud, let alone every Tom, Dick, and Harry." the TV said.

".. just completely out there in the world, huh."

".. yeah-"

A door opens abruptly.
Light queues in, silhouettes, shifting through latent beams, a figure.
The door bell rings.
