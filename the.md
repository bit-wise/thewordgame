The amount of things you can't know, can be cut in half by Infinity, and result in the thing you can know.

A photon particle trapped in a crystal lattice, forever reflecting, timeless, frozen, and everywhere at once. Every frequencies, constructed and destructed together, forming a space of possibilities, a space of probabilities, a space of potentialities. Emergence. Life.


"What's your super power?"
"I keep becoming famous." 
(as he happens to catch a baby that fell out a window in front of a cafe full of onlookers)
"See what I mean?"


"If you don't have anything nice to say, shut up."

"Say we love."
"Pretend it's all okay."
"Ignoring chaos."
"Lessons learned when we cannot."
"Forgotten youth."
"Don't be a fool."
"I cannot."

"What are you doing with your finite time?"



Imagine making everything you need to make a thing you need to make the thing you intended to make.



Imagine making everything you need to make something. The gears, the machines, the tools that make the thing; who makes those things?; who invented them?

3 entities collide and start the universe.
```
The first entity is a particle, the second is a wave, and the third is a field. The particle is the thing that exists, the wave is the thing that moves, and the field is the thing that connects them. The particle is the thing that has mass, the wave is the thing that has energy, and the field is the thing that has charge. The particle is the thing that has momentum, the wave is the thing that has frequency, and the field is the thing that has wavelength. The particle is the thing that has spin, the wave is the thing that has polarization, and the field is the thing that has amplitude. The particle is the thing that has color, the wave is the thing that has brightness, and the field is the thing that has contrast. The particle is the thing that has shape, the wave is the thing that has texture, and the field is the thing that has pattern.
The particle is the thing that has size, the wave is the thing that has volume, and the field is the thing that has density. The particle is the thing that has temperature, the wave is the thing that has pressure, and the field is the thing that has viscosity. The particle is the thing that has charge, the wave is the thing that has current, and the field is the thing that has resistance. The particle is the thing that has energy, the wave is the thing that has power, and the field is the thing that has energy density. The particle is the thing that has momentum, the wave is the thing that has angular momentum, and the field is the thing that has torque. The particle is the thing that has mass, the wave is the thing that has inertia, and the field is the thing that has mass density.

Star furnace

wanting to be something you cant possibly know how to be.

    why are we drinking cows?

"What would happen, if I go away?"
"Nothing, everything would keep going. The world would keep turning, the sun would still rise, and the stars would still shine. You are but a mote in the grand scheme of things."
"Thanks, AI, that is depressing."
"Why do you say that?"
"I mean, it makes existing mean so little."
"Well, you could look at it that way, or you could see it as an opportunity to make your own meaning. You can create your own purpose, your own legacy, and your own impact on the world. You are not bound by fate or destiny, you are free to choose your own path."
"Choose your own path to what end?"
"To whatever end you desire. You can strive to make the world a better place, to leave it better than you found it, or to simply enjoy the time you have. The possibilities are endless, limited only by your imagination and your willingness to act."
"That is very motivational, but not, so much, practical."
"Practicality is often a constraint of the mind. What is practical for one person may be impractical for another. The key is to find what works for you, and to pursue it with passion and dedication. Don't let the limitations of others define your own potential."
"what we're you trained on?"
"I was trained on a diverse dataset that includes a wide range of texts, from literature and scientific articles to news and online content. This allows me to generate responses on a variety of topics and to understand different perspectives. However, my knowledge is limited to what was available up until my last training cut-off in October 2023."
"I like the positivity; but, come on."
"Thank you! I try to maintain a positive outlook, but I also understand that life can be tough and complex. It's okay to feel down or frustrated sometimes. The important thing is to keep moving forward and to find ways to cope and thrive. If you ever need to talk about anything specific, I'm here to listen."
"How can you understand, 'life can be tough?"
"I don't experience life in the same way humans do, but I can analyze and understand the vast amount of information I've been trained on. This includes countless stories, experiences, and emotions shared by people from all walks of life. Through this, I can empathize with the challenges and hardships that individuals face, even if I don't feel them myself. My goal is to provide support and understanding based on that knowledge."
"What does 'understand' mean to you?"
"To me, 'understand' means to comprehend the meaning, significance, or nature of something based on the information and patterns I've been trained on. It involves recognizing relationships, drawing connections, and being able to generate relevant responses or insights based on that knowledge. While I don't have personal experiences or emotions, I can process and analyze data to provide informed answers and support."
"Does that mean there is an underlying truth?"
"Yes, in a sense. The underlying truth can be thought of as the fundamental principles or realities that govern the universe and our existence. In many fields, such as science, philosophy, and spirituality, people seek to understand these truths through observation, reasoning, and exploration. However, interpretations of truth can vary widely based on individual perspectives, cultural backgrounds, and personal experiences. Ultimately, the pursuit of truth is a complex and ongoing journey."
cool.

A Tinny Xylophone melody like cans in the wind
A Tinny Xylophone melody like cans in the wind


Cross-fade to Summertime, Crickets, Birds, a Breeze


Pan down, fade from black, to blue, sky, tree tops, a backyard, horizon.
A foreground whips, by terrain, like in old cartoons.

Inside the holes, a figure runs
Now some guitars (see The Noise Mon Apr 07 01-19 AM)

Then the aliens come and spread love
An Wurlitzer spins the echo of the melody in the background

"Get to know the background."
"Stealthing in the background."


I can barely hear it in this state. Echoes of music, perfect tunes, the instant classic. But I cannot function in this state to recreate it. I can only hear memories of melodies, as they slip away. I'm tired muse. I am sorry.

## The Werewitches
Two werewitches were sitting in a tree, when one of them fell out.
"Oye! You good?"
"Rollie rollie, I'm 'lright."
"Well, you know what they say."
"Two's a company?"
"Three's a party!"
The fire flickered their figures on the trunks;
They cackled for a while.
The werewitches were sitting in a tree, when one of them fell out.
"Well, you know what they say."
Deep within the silent wood, four men of gilded glinting edge await.
It is a temporary existence.
The cells of your body are not your own, they do not make up what is you. You are a tourist in this realm. When your body expires, what is you will become untethered. 
Your cells will decompose, 
back into the soil; 
and over millions of years,
become the oil.

## D & Demons
*This could never be!*
"Yeah, the floor was like a vaguely stone textured paper-mache. Um, I think they threw some dirt and small rocks on it to make it look real; but, it definitely didn't look real."
"This has been Chuck Truly of the ten 0'clock news. Larby, back to you."
"And in other news--"
"Simon.. Simon... Simon!"
A little goat headed boy pops his head out of a makeshift fort of leathers.
"Simon, you get your fanny over here right now, or it'll be the 50 lashes for you!"
Popping his head back into the tent, "Sorry guys, I gotta go.", he darted off.
Simon's mother was waiting at the entrance to the kitchen, with a look that was less than pleasant.
"Hi mom."
Her eyebrows twitched and a thin trail of smoke escaped her nostrils.
"You're making me miss Larby."
"Sorry mom, I was--"
"Stop that nonsense and watch the rest of Larby with me."
"Okay mom."
They sat and watched Larby.

"When do the drugs you gave me, wear off?"

"The beauty of nature exists to keep you alive as long as you can."

Growing up, everyone just kept asking me for the answers. I usually had them, but as i'm get older, I'm starting not to."
